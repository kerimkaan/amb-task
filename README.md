# Amb-Task

This demo project was created with [React (*CRA*)](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and Material-UI. 

## Installation and Running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
